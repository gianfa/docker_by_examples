# Cooked Docker images

In this folder I collect Dockerfiles that I needed to customize, in order to obtain a specific image to work with.  
The Dockerfiles are ready to be used, just rename them as "Dockerfile".  

At the moment you will find:
1. MSSQL_pyodbc_python3-Dockerfile.
    * MSSQL Server on Ubuntu 16.04. Comes with Python3.6 and Python2.7, pyodbc, pandas and flask.
